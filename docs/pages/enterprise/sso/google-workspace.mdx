## Google Workspace as SSO for SSH

This guide will cover how to configure [Google Workspace](https://workspace.google.com/) to be a
single sign-on (SSO) provider to issue SSH credentials to specific groups of users.
When used in combination with role based access control (RBAC) it allows SSH administrators
to define policies like:

- Only members of "DBA" Google group can SSH into machines running PostgreSQL.
- Developers must never SSH into production servers.
- ... and many others.

  This guide requires an enterprise version of Teleport.
</Admonition>

## Prerequisites

Before you get started youâ€™ll need:

- Either an Enterprise version of Teleport (downloaded via the [Enterprise dashboard](https://dashboard.gravitational.com/web/login)) or a Teleport Cloud account (sign up for a [free trial](https://goteleport.com/signup/)).
- A Google Workspace account with a Super Admin role. We recommend setting up a separate account with 2FA for this instead of using your typical Google Workspace account (e.g., use ben-ops@example.com instead of ben@example.com).
- Ability to create a Google Cloud project, which requires signing up for Google Cloud. Note that this guide will not require using any paid Google Cloud services.
- A [verified domain](https://support.google.com/a/answer/60216?hl=en).
- Ability to set up Google Workspace groups

## Configure Google Workspace

1. Obtain OAuth 2.0 credentials
   [https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OpenIDConnect](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OpenIDConnect)
2. Create a new project.
   ![Create New Project](../../../img/gsuite/gsuite-1-new-project.png)
3. Select "OAuth client ID".
   ![Create OAuth Creds](../../../img/gsuite/gsuite-2-created-creds.png)
4. Set "Application type" to "Public" and set up domain verification.
   ![Setup Application Type](../../../img/gsuite/gsuite-3-oauth.png)
5. Copy the OAuth Client ID and Client Secret, which we will use later when configuring SSO.

## Create a service account

![Create OAuth Creds](../../../img/gsuite/gsuite-5a-service-account.png)

Leave the "users role" and "admins role" fields blank.

![Create OAuth Creds](../../../img/gsuite/gsuite-5b-service-account.png)

Leave the "Service account permissions" field blank.

### Enable account delegation

### Download service account JSON

![Create OAuth Creds](../../../img/gsuite/gsuite-5f-download-json.png)

This JSON file will need to be uploaded to the Teleport Auth Server, and will be later referenced by
the OIDC Connector, under `google_service_account_uri` or inline with `google_service_account`.

<Admonition type="note">
  Teleport requires the service account JSON to be uploaded to all Teleport Auth Server hosts when deploying Teleport in a High Availability configuration.
</Admonition>

## Manage API scopes

Copy the client ID of your service account. To manage API client access within Google Workspace, go to Security -> Settings.  Navigate to Advanced Settings and open Manage API client access. Put the client ID in the Client Name field and the below permissions in the API scopes as a single comma-separated line. Press Authorize.

**Client Name:** Use the unique ID for the service account ([see video for instructions](https://youtu.be/DG97l8WJ6oU?t=281)).

**API Scopes:** Copy these three API Scopes.


```
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.group.member.readonly, https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.group.readonly, https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.user.readonly
```

## Create an OIDC connector

Create the following OIDC connector [resource spec](../../setup/reference/resources.mdx) as `gsuite-connector.yaml`. We will explain how to choose values for fields within the resource spec.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Google Service Account via URI">
    ```yaml
    (!examples/resources/gworkspace-connector.yaml!)
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Google Service Account via inline (required for Teleport Cloud)">
    ```yaml
    (!examples/resources/gworkspace-connector-inline.yaml!)
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

There are two options for setting the `google_service_account` value. You can set the JSON file in the auth server and give a URI to the file.
The second is populating the contents via inline.  Inline is required for Teleport Cloud.

The email that you set for `google_admin_email` **must** be the email address of a user that has permission to list all groups, users, and group membership in your Google Workspace account. This user will generally need Super Admin privileges.

<Admonition
type="tip"
title="Warning"
>
Do not use the email of the service account. The configuration display will look the same, but the service account will not have the required domain-wide delegation.
</Admonition>

The `client_id` field must be the unique ID number captured from the admin UI. An indicator that this is misconfigured is if you see "Client is unauthorized to retrieve access tokens using this method, or client not authorized for any of the scopes requested." in your log.


Create the connector using `tctl` tool:

```bsh
$ tctl create gworkspace-connector.yaml
```

## Testing

The Web UI will now contain a new button: "Login with Google". The CLI is
the same as before:

```bsh
$ tsh --proxy=proxy.example.com login
```

This command will print the SSO login URL (and will try to open it
automatically in a browser).

  Teleport can use multiple OIDC connectors. In this case a connector name
  can be passed via `tsh login --auth=google`
</Admonition>

## Troubleshooting

If you get "access denied" errors the number one place to check is the audit
log on the Teleport auth server. It is located in `/var/lib/teleport/log` by
default and it will contain the detailed reason why a user's login was denied.

Example of a user being denied due as the role `clusteradmin` wasn't setup.

```json
{"code":"T1001W","error":"role clusteradmin is not found","event":"user.login","method":"oidc","success":false,"time":"2019-06-15T19:38:07Z","uid":"cd9e45d0-b68c-43c3-87cf-73c4e0ec37e9"}
```

Some errors (like filesystem permissions or misconfigured network) can be
diagnosed using Teleport's `stderr` log, which is usually available via:

```bsh
$ sudo journalctl -fu teleport
```

If you wish to increase the verbosity of Teleport's syslog, you can pass the
[`--debug`](../../setup/reference/cli.mdx#teleport-start) flag to `teleport start` command.
